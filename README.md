This module provides an isomorphic render method for React components in an Express compatible application.

## Usage

```
$ npm install --save react-express-middleware react react-dom
```

`index.js`:

```javascript
// The [router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/router) package is the new
// standalone router used in Express 5.0. This example uses express directly,
// but there is also a compatible browser module which wraps `router` called
// [nighthawk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nighthawk) which can be a drop
// in replacement on the client side.  Either of these require lines will
// work with the middleware.  If you a clever, you can even make this example
// function in both the browser and server via browserify :)
// var router = require('nighthawk')();
var router = require('express')();
var reactExpressMiddleware = require('react-express-middleware');
var ReactComponent = require('./component.jsx');

router.use(reactExpressMiddleware({
	element: 'app'
}));
router.get('/', function (req, res) {
	res.renderReactComponent(ReactComponent);
});
```

`index.html`
```html
<html>
	<head></head>
	<body>
		<div id="app"><%- content %></div>
	</body>
</html>
```

**Note:** The module does not specify a react dependency so you can depend on whatever react version you want.  We only require greater than React 0.14.0

## Passing data to your React components

If you are using React then you have probably heard of Flux and Redux.  This module works seamlessly with these architectures because it expects your application state to be stored in a single object.  This object, often called a `store`, can be passed as the second argument to `renderReactComponent`:

```javascript
router.get('/', function (req, res) {
	// Store some data on res.locals which is provided
	// by express and a pretty common practice
	res.locals.foo = 'bar';

	// Pass res.locals as your store
	res.renderReactComponent(ReactComponent, res.locals);
});
```

As it turns out, this middleware will do the above by default, so if you don't pass a store you will automagically get all of the properties from `res.locals` passed as props to your component.

## Example

Run the working example by running `npm run example` from the root.

You can also see a very simplistic example for use with nighthawk: https://github.com/wesleytodd/nighthawk/tree/master/example/react
