This module provides an isomorphic render method for React components in an Express compatible application.

## Coming Soon!

The 4.0 branch is coming soon.  It is a rework which provides a much more consistent interface and is more "express like".  It adds some
great features, but also breaks some old ones.  I am not doing a deprecation cycle in `3.x` because there is no reason the 3.x branch cannot
just continue working as is.  If you wish to keep using this, then GREAT!  But if you want to give the new version a try, here is how:

```
npm install --save react-express-middleware@next
```

You can check out the progress here:

- https://github.com/wesleytodd/react-express-middleware/tree/4.0
- https://github.com/wesleytodd/react-express-middleware/pull/10

## Usage

```
$ npm install --save react-express-middleware react react-dom
```

**Note:** The module does not specify a react dependency so you can depend on whatever react version you want.  We only require greater than React 0.14.0.
